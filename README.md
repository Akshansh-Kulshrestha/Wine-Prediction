# Wine-Prediction

The aim of this project is to predict wine quality based on various chemical properties using the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology. We utilize two datasets, one for red wine and one for white wine, both containing numerous attributes and quality ratings. This project focues our approach, from understanding the business problem to deploying the final model.

The project is structured following the CRISP-DM methodology, providing detailed insights into each phase. The ultimate goal is to deploy a machine learning model that can accurately predict wine quality, offering valuable insights for stakeholders in the wine industry.

**# Objectives:**

•	Define the problem: Predict wine quality based on chemical properties.
•	Identify stakeholders: Vineyard owners, producers, quality control teams, and consumers.
•	Determine suitability for an analytics solution: The problem is highly suitable for machine learning due to the availability of data and clear target variable (quality).
•	Define business benefits: Improved quality control, enhanced production processes, and better consumer satisfaction.
